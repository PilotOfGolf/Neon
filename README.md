HackClub Neon YSWS Submission

With moments left for the submission, I completed my project lmao. 

This is a display that shows when the next radio pass of the International Space Station goes near the observer. 

Default is 45 degrees, but it can be changed to allow more passes to be displayed. It only goes up for 1 day ahed. This is to save the N2YO servers from doing too much processing. Any further would not be needed, and just be a waste of computing power.
